                <p>
                    Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation 
                    are provided an educational context in which they can explore 
                    the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense 
                    critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by 
                    distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional 
                    artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
                </p>
    
                <p>The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered 
                    on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are 
                    the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured 
                    courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the 
                    rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely 
                    exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members 
                    and visitors. 
                </p>
                <p>The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale 
                    College (see the bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, 
                    the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts
                     and Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and School 
                     of Art students may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate School and
                      other professional schools as well as in the College with permission.

                <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
                <p>
                    The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students with 
                    intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in the practice of an 
                    array of visual arts media within the context of a liberal arts university. 
                    As a part of the first institution of higher learning to successfully 
                    integrate a studio-based education into such a broad pedagogical framework, 
                    the Yale School of Art has a long and distinguished history of training 
                    artists of the highest caliber. A full-time faculty of working artists 
                    in conjunction with a diverse cross-section of accomplished visiting
                     artists collaborate to design a program and foster an environment where 
                     the unique talents and perspectives of individual students can emerge and 
                    flourish.
                </P>
                <p>The School of Art is founded on the belief that art is a fundamental force 
                    in national and international culture, and that one of the primary 
                    standards by which societies are judged is the quality, creative freedom, 
                    critical insight, and formal and technical innovation of the visual art 
                    they produce. The Yale School of Art teaches at the graduate and 
                    undergraduate levels, and consequently the student body consists of 
                    those whose primary or exclusive focus is art as well as those for whom 
                    art is an essential part of a varied course of inquiry. The school 
                    currently offers degrees and undergraduate majors in the areas of graphic 
                    design, painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture.
